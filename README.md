# 🤖 NEAR AI Deepfake Detection Agent

> **First-of-kind decentralized deepfake detection using NEAR Shade Agents + 0G Network**

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a **1-Day Hackathon MVP** that demonstrates autonomous AI agents on NEAR Protocol for deepfake detection. The project integrates:

- **NEAR Shade Agents** - Autonomous AI agents running on NEAR blockchain
- **0G Network** - Decentralized storage for media files
- **Next.js Frontend** - Modern web interface with beautiful UI
- **Smart Contracts** - On-chain result storage and verification

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
Next.js Frontend (React + Tailwind)
    ↓
NEAR Shade Agent (Python + AI Detection)
    ↓ 
NEAR Smart Contract (Rust + Result Storage)
    ↓
0G Network (Decentralized File Storage)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup NEAR Account

```bash
# Export your NEAR account
export NEAR_ACCOUNT=your-account.testnet

# Login to NEAR
nearai login
```

### 2. Deploy Agent

```bash
# Rename agent folder
mv deepfake-agent.testnet $NEAR_ACCOUNT

# Deploy to NEAR AI registry
nearai registry upload $NEAR_ACCOUNT/deepfake-detector
```

### 3. Run Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🤖 Agent Features

The NEAR Shade Agent includes:

- **Mock AI Detection** - Simulates advanced deepfake detection
- **Confidence Scoring** - Returns confidence percentages (60-99%)
- **Analysis Reasons** - Detailed explanations of detection results
- **Blockchain Storage** - Results stored on NEAR for verification
- **Multiple Formats** - Supports images and videos

### Agent Commands

```bash
# Test locally
python deepfake-agent.testnet/deepfake-detector/agent.py

# Deploy to NEAR
nearai registry upload $NEAR_ACCOUNT/deepfake-detector

# View on NEAR AI
open https://app.near.ai/agents/$NEAR_ACCOUNT/deepfake-detector
```

## 🌐 Frontend Features

The Next.js frontend provides:

- **Beautiful UI** - Modern gradient design with glass morphism
- **Drag & Drop Upload** - Easy file uploading with react-dropzone
- **Real-time Processing** - Live progress indicators
- **Detailed Results** - Comprehensive analysis display
- **Wallet Integration** - NEAR wallet connection (mocked for demo)
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile

### Key Components

- `WalletConnection` - NEAR wallet integration
- `FileUpload` - Drag and drop file handling
- `DetectionResults` - Analysis results display

## 🔧 Smart Contract

The Rust smart contract handles:

- **Result Storage** - Stores detection results on-chain
- **Agent Authorization** - Manages authorized agents
- **Statistics** - Tracks total scans and results
- **Verification** - Provides immutable proof of detection

### Contract Methods

```rust
// Store detection results
store_detection_result(file_hash, is_deepfake, confidence, ...)

// Retrieve results
get_detection_result(file_hash) -> Option<DetectionResult>

// Get statistics
get_total_scans() -> u64
get_deepfake_count() -> u64
```

## 🎯 Demo Flow

1. **Connect Wallet** - User connects NEAR wallet (mocked)
2. **Upload File** - Drag & drop media file
3. **AI Processing** - Agent analyzes file (3-second simulation)
4. **Show Results** - Display detection results with confidence
5. **Blockchain Storage** - Results stored on NEAR (simulated)

## 🔍 Detection Logic

The mock AI detection:

- Uses file hash for deterministic results
- ~33% of files detected as deepfakes
- Confidence scores between 60-99%
- Multiple realistic analysis reasons
- Processing time simulation (2.5-3.5 seconds)

## 🛠️ Development

### Environment Variables

```bash
# NEAR Configuration
